My name is Ang√©lique. 

My background is in electronics and microelectronics. 
I have worked with data and used Excel to analyze the data with basics in statistics. 
I do not have a background in data analysis and data science. 
I have knowledge in c, c++ and VHDL coding.

I would like to learn new skills in data analysis. I hope to have more projects related to data science in my current position or even work in a position where it would be fully related to it.
